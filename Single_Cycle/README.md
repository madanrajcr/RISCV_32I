# RISC-V 32I Single Cycle Design

## Project Overview
This project is an implementation of a single cycle RISC-V 32I processor design. The RISC-V 32I instruction set architecture (ISA) is a free and open RISC instruction set architecture based on established RISC principles.

The goal of this project is to design and implement a basic RISC-V 32I processor that can execute a subset of the RISC-V instructions in a single clock cycle.

## Key Features
- Supports a subset of the RISC-V 32I instruction set, including:
  - Integer arithmetic and logical instructions
  - Load and store instructions
  - Branch and jump instructions
- Implemented using a single-cycle design approach
- Written in SystemVerilog
- Includes a testbench for verifying the functionality of the processor

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/madanrajcr/RISCV_32I.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd RISCV32I/Single_Cycle
   ```
3. Compile the project using your preferred SystemVerilog compiler.
4. Run the testbench `riscv_top_tb.sv` to verify the functionality of the RISC-V 32I processor.
